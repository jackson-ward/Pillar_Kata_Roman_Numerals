Hello Pillar Representative!

This file should have been included with my submission for the Roman Numeral Kata Excercise.

The source code included with my submission represents my best effort in delivering a complete solution
developed entirely by myself using TDD.

I must say I battled with myself back and forth on many occasions as to whether I was sure I was
using Pillar's method of TDD correctly or efficiently. I think there were moments where I may have 
been a bit off (especially during the beginning phases) and I also think there are moments where 
I used TDD exactly as intended and quite effectively. I kept all working code regardless of how I felt 
about my use of TDD in creating it (I did not once ignore the concept) because I believe this 
will help me to relay to you the story of how I created my solution. I hope that you will see value in my
submission, that you will feel I am the right candidate for the job, and that my efforts so far
will merrit an invitation to Michigan.

I can be reached at 985-705-5549 or at jward93@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you.

Please view the Readme for simple instructions on how to build and run these programs.

Thank You,
Jackson Ward
